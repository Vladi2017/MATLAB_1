# MATLAB_1
1. eup = empirical_univariate_plot. 2. Other few commented scripts and support files (explanations + graphics render-able on GitHub).

### Content:
MATLAB/Lab1.m - (basic), Generate two 3000 Hz sinusoids with different amplitudes and phases and sum them.

MATLAB/Lab2.m - (advanced), heavy commented lab script about analyzing audio signals: Fast Fourier Transform, resampling, main spectral components. Also there are filtering demos: FIR filter, IIR filter, Butterworth filter synthesis, Z-plane zeros-poles analyzing, unstable filter, spectograms. (require "pkg load signal").

Vld1/Vld1.m - complex plane basic stuff.

Vld1/realDFT1.m - realDFT, x[n] signal synthesis from Discrete Fourier Transform. (also please see the support files)

Vld1/eup.m - empirical_univariate_plot. Empirical probability distribution plots. There are some DEMOs explained (see eupDEMOs.pdf), but the script could have practical utility as well (eg. you can statistical analyze your own data acquisition set).
